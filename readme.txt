I am using img1.jpeg and img2.jpeg as my input image.
I have resized both imaged to (300,600) and i am using 100 number of intermediate images to create the gif so my program is taking apprx 55secs to 1 minutes.But if we change these 2 parameters then the program will take significantly much less time.
On execution my program will create 2 .gif files:-
1 named as "morphinginbuilt.gif" which is answer for part B in our assignment
other is named as "morphingusinginputfile.gif" which is answer for part A in our assignment(it will take tie points as input from "input.txt" in the format as described in the assignment.
